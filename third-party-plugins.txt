Here are some third-party plugins that I've found useful for using WordPress to power a web app:

1. Next Page, Not Post for navigating between pages in a series. (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/next-page-not-next-post/)

2. Simple User Password Generator creates long, complex passwords for new users in a single click. Great if you're setting up new accounts for private beta testing. (http://10up.com/plugins/simple-user-password-generator-wordpress/)

3. Maintenance Mode. If you need to make updates that require downtime, Maintenance Mode will display a splash screen while you do your thing. (http://sw-guide.de/wordpress/plugins/maintenance-mode/)

4. WordPress Database Backups will help protect you from data loss (your users will thank you). Download full backups of the database directly, or schedule them to be emailed to you hourly, daily, weekly or more. (http://austinmatzko.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-db-backup/) 

5. Export Users to CSV let's you run reports on your users, including all user meta data. If you use the "Favorite Posts" functionality, you'll need to add that field into the report by modifying the plugin. At the end of the $data_keys array, add 'faveposts'. (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/export-users-to-csv/)

6. Bootstrap isn't a plugin, but it does feature a ton of useful add-ons for building web apps, including alerts, modals, drop-downs and more. Brought you by the fine folks at Twitter. (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
