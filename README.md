Getting started with WordPress for Web Apps is as simple as installing a plugin:

- `[wpwa_referrer]` - Adds `referrer={{current page URL}}`, handy for login/signup redirects (can be included in a `wp_nav_menu()` URL)

### User Access

All pages will now include a metabox labeled *User Access*. Select `Everyone`, `Only Logged In Users`, or `Only Logged Out Users` as desired and publish or update your page.

```php
do_action( 'wpwebapp_after_login', $username );
```

#### wpwebapp_after_signup

Runs after a user has signed up. Passes in the new user's `$username` and `$email` as arguments.

```php
do_action( 'wpwebapp_after_signup', $username, $email );
```

#### wpwebapp_after_email_change

Runs after a user has changed their email address. Passes in the user's `$user_id` and `$old_email` as arguments.

```

#### wpwebapp_after_password_change

```

### Redirecting after login or signup

To redirect a user back to their current page after login or sign up, add the `referrer={{current URL}}` query string to the login or sign up page URL, where `{{current URL}}` is the URL of the page the user is currently on. You can also use the `[wpwa_referrer]` shortcode to handle this dynamically.



## CSS Hooks

Every form and input includes a unique `id` you can hook into for styling. Additionally, form element categories also include shared classes you can use to easily style like elements in a consistent way.

- `.wpwebapp-form-label` - Form labels
- `.wpwebapp-form-input` - Text inputs
- `.wpwebaspp-form-password` - Password inputs
- `.wpwebapp-form-button` - Form buttons and input[type="submit"]
- `.wpwebapp-form-label-checkbox` - Labels for checkboxes
- `.wpwebapp-form-checkbox` - Checkboxes
